# TableTesting

✨ Automating Tables with Selenium WebDriver 🖥️

🚀 Project Overview:
In my Selenium project, LoginTest2, I automated table-related tasks on a webpage for better understanding and hands-on practice. Here's the workflow I followed:

🔧 Prerequisites:
1️⃣ Installed IntelliJ IDEA Community (v2018.3.6)
2️⃣ Configured OpenJDK 11
3️⃣ Set up ChromeDriver for browser automation
4️⃣ Created a Selenium project titled LoginTest2

🌐 Target URL:
🔗 Test Automation Practice Page

📝 Automation Goals:
1️⃣ Count the number of rows in the table.
2️⃣ Identify the number of columns in the table.
3️⃣ Retrieve and display the total data in the table.

👨‍💻 Tech Stack:

Selenium WebDriver
Java
IntelliJ IDEA
ChromeDriver
🎯 Code Logic: I implemented WebDriver to interact with the table elements dynamically and fetch the required row, column, and cell data.

✨ Why This Matters:
Automating tables is essential for validating structured data during UI testing, ensuring applications perform accurately.
